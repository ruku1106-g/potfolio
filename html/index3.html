    <h1><i>The Minimalist Web :</i> Crafting Pages with Only the Basics</h1>
    <p><b>By Alex Parker</b> | Published: August 15,2025</p>

<p>In a world where websites are loaded with flashy animations,heavy scripts, and high-resolution images, the art of building a pure,
    <i>lightweight</i> webpage is nearly forgotten. this article explores the charm and power of HTML's <mark>simplest tags</mark>.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Back-to-Basics Movement</h2>
    <p> Back in the early days of the internet, webpages were nothing more than plain text,sprinkled with <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> styles. the focus was on the <b>content</b>, not the decoration.In many ways,this was the <i>golden age</i> of readability.</p>
    
    <p>The <du>HTML</du> language itself was designed for structure-- headings,paragraphs, and semanti meaning.E=mc<sup>2</sup> still looks good without a single pixel of css, and H<sub>2</sub>O remains as clar as ever.</p>

    <h2>Why Strip It Down?</h2>
    <p>There's a quiet beauty in simplicity.Without distractions,readers focus on the words."Minimalism is not the lack of something,it's the perfect amount of something,"as a famous designer once said.</p>
    
    <p>Removing images and heavy layouts means faster load times,better accessibility, and even nostalgia for the <del>chaotic</del> <u>simpler</u> internet days.</p>

    <h2> Magazine-Style Sections</h2>

    <p>Just like in a printed magazine,articles can be divided with <u>bold headings</u> and subtle serpartiors.Think of &lt;hr&gt; as the thin line between chapters, and headings as your section titles. </p>

    <p>You can even keep a "side not" feel with smaller text for author comments or additional reading hints.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>A Practical Demonstration</h2>
    <p>Imagine we are decribing a recipe in this minimal style:</p>
    <p>Step 1: Mix 150g of flour with H<sub>2</sub>O until smooth. Step 2: Heat at 180<sup>o</sup>C for 30 minutes.Step 3:<del>serve cold</del><ins>Serve warm</ins>for best taste.</p>

    <p>Code snippet: <small>temperature = 180; //degree Celcius</small></p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Closing Thought</h2>
    <p>Stripping a webpages down to its <b>bare essentials</b>is not just a design choice --- it's a statement.It says:"The words matter more than the wrapping."</p>

    <p>So the next time you open a code editor, try creating a page with nothing but <i>heading,paragraphs,</i>and <i>text formating.</i>you might just rediscover the timeless elegance of the early web.</p>
